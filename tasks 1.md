## INTRODUCTION SURVEY

I have created a form to collect information with google forms. google forms is a free tool to collect information. For the purpose of this project we need to collect some information from medical centers. This information will be useful for the patients who will want to have care.

## form question

the first question on the form is about the **name of the hospital**
it is important to know the name of the hospital because it will allow us to verify for ourselves the veracity of the information provided.

Then we have the question about the **continent(s)**, **country** and **city** where the hospital is located. This information will be important because it will allow us to know more quickly which medical center the patient can go to.

The next question is about **language**.
We are well aware that the world is made up of many languages and it is essential for our system to have fluid communication and information.

We have a question about **the services offered**.
It is very important for our system to know the services offered by the different medical centers registered in our system. Why ?
Because by knowing it, we will then know where to designate the patients to be registered in our system.

The question about **the equipment** is important because some medical centers offer services but do not have adequate equipment. For example, they cannot offer services in skin incisions and lack surgical scalpel. This deficiency will also affect the well-being of the patients registered on our system.

The **number of specialists and the number of patients accepted** is important because when there are enough specialists, the services are done quickly and also we are sure to have a free result. Secondly, some hospitals have a limited number of rooms and beds, which is a big deficiency if patients do not have a place to sleep.

Some **hospitals offer free treatment**. So we asked a question in this sense because it will be an advantage for us and the various patients registered in our system.
