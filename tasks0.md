## TASKS0 Research and create a list of 50 active global hospitals

It is essential for us to identify several hospitals for our system. In this task it was a question for us of **listing 50 international hospitals active, their website, the services they offer, the countries and cities where they are located**. We identified by filtering the information. Why do we need to list his hospitals? This will allow us to filter the information and also have an idea of ​​each medical center and the overall number of its hospitals will allow us to better implement our application.
