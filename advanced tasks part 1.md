# advanced tasks part 1

Before any time to advance in this task it is important for us to create a logo for our system.

## creation of a logo

A **logo** is very important because it identifies and is unique to a company. Before creating a logo it is important to carefully analyze the words and what we want our logo to refer to. For the case of this project we have chosen the name of **global link medical**. The colors referring to the country carrying the project which is Cameroon. Why this name?
This name because several companies will be grouped in our application to help patients worldwide.
