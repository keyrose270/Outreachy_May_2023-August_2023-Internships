PRESENTATION AND PURPOSE:

Hello my name is KEY NKOT ROSE SIDONIE Network and Telecommunication Engineer and Cameroonian of nationality. I have been interested in programming for a very long time because my mind always brought me back to this side. Indeed, it's been a few months since I decided to launch myself and I don't regret it because I am surrounded by a community of web and mobile developers. I have a passion for web and mobile development. My biggest desire was to work on projects that could give me experience to be more attractive on the job market.  My meeting with Outreachy was for me like the answer to my wishes and also to come across projects that could help Africa was a real motivation for me.  My eyes are turned towards the mboalab project for several reasons:
The first one is that it gathers all the skills that I wish to learn and improve.
Secondly, it will allow me to understand quickly and quickly with the help of the mentors and the team members the most demanded technologies on the market
thirdly it will allow me to help my continent Africa to have more openness for treatments and donations to avoid early deaths
fourth it will allow me to fulfill my great dream of developing an application that will help the world.

The task that has my full attention and that I will work on is the advanced task 2 because it challenges me to be sharp and fast in understanding the design and also to flutter because I love to discover. Work beats talent and I know that as I go along with my research I could improve.

Contribution: . I would propose that we add a donation part to help those who will not have the means to acquire treatment as well.
