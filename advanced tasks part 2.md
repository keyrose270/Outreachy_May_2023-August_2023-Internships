# creation of the design on figma

figma allows us to create prototypes to facilitate the creation of mobile applications.
I created part of the site design for our global link medical application.

## Presentation

the first part of our design is about the presentation of the application and the registration to the platform.
a mobile application is good but the presentation will let users know what to expect in the environment.
